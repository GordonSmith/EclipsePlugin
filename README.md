Building with Maven:
----------
From the project root directory, execute <b>mvn clean verify</b>

NOTE:  Certain file types in the <b>build.properties</b> file in the <b>org.hpccsystems.ecldoc</b> project have been removed to eliminate compile errors with Maven.  When those file types exist in that project, the original <b>build.properties</b> can be restored.
